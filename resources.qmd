## Required software
- R: <http://www.r-project.org/> (FREE)
- RStudio (additional libraries required): <http://www.rstudio.com/> (FREE)

## Prework

Before attending the any workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.
-   Recent version of **R**
-   Recent version of **RStudio**
-   Most recent release of the [**Bioconductor**](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) and other packages used in courses

Install the latest release of R, then get the latest version of Bioconductor by starting R and entering the commands. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")
```

- Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

    -   Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document
    -   Save the document and check you are able to knit it.

## Install Bioconductor Packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```

Install specific packages, e.g., “GenomicFeatures” and “AnnotationDbi”, with


```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi"))
```

The `install()` function (in the BiocManager package) has arguments that change its default behavior; type ?install for further help.
