## Abstract
This report presents the near-complete genome sequences of 14 bacteriophages that infect Salmonella Typhi, identified through environmental surveillance in Bangladesh between August 2021 and June 2022. The bacteriophages, belonging to the genus Kayfunavirus, Macdonaldcampvirus, and Teseptimavirus, share evolutionary ties with previously documented Typhi bacteriophages.

**Key Findings:**
- The bacteriophages show significant potential for furthering our understanding of Salmonella Typhi pathogenesis.
- Highlighted the importance of environmental surveillance in tracking bacterial and viral interactions.
- Provided potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.
