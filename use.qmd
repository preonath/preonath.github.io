# Metagenomics 
**QIIME2 :** Instead of taking changes over time into account, static modelling in SPSS entails building and evaluating models that represent relationships within a dataset at a particular point in time. ANOVA, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis are common methods. Data preparation, variable selection, model construction, and evaluation are all steps in the process. Coefficients, p-values, and R-squared are used in output interpretation to determine the significance and strength of relationships. Applications include business analytics, social sciences, and market research. It is crucial to take into account presumptions and constraints, such as the presumption of ongoing relationships. Static modelling helps with decision-making based on observed patterns by offering insights into cross-sectional data.
