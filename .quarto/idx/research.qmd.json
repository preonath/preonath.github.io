In mild cases, fever, rash, and sore muscles and joints resemble flu symptoms. serious dengue fever can result in hypotension, serious bleeding, and even death.\n\nDengue transmission dynamics are influenced by climate variables like temperature and precipitation since the virus is spread by mosquitoes. Despite the complexity of the relationship, an increasing number of scientists contend that changes in distribution brought about by climate change would likely have a major impact on public health globally.\n\nDengue fever has been increasing in recent years. Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands have historically had the highest rates of the illness.\n\n## Paediatric pneumonia detection from X‑ray images using deep learning\n\n### Abstract \nPneumonia continues to be the most common cause of illness and death for children under five years old in low- and middle-income countries, posing a persistent threat to their health. Although paediatric pneumonia is common, the diagnosis process is largely based on the subjective interpretation of chest X-ray images, which introduces variability and necessitates expert opinion. The current paradigm, in which physicians or radiologists evaluate images on an individual basis, is non-standardized and makes it more difficult to make timely and accurate diagnoses.\n\nOur research attempts to address this difficulty by developing a deep learning-based computational tool that is especially intended for the diagnosis of paediatric pneumonia. Unlike existing approaches, ours is trained on an extensive dataset of X-ray images that have been carefully reviewed by a group of experts. Of note, these professionals have.\n\n## Prediction of Missing DNA Methylation fromWhole Genome Bisulfite Data Using KNN\n\n### Abstract \nOne important epigenetic alteration that is essential for controlling gene expression and other biological functions is DNA methylation. One effective method for single-base resolution DNA methylation profiling is Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS). However, missing methylation values in WGBS datasets are frequently the consequence of technical difficulties and experimental limitations. It is imperative to address these absent values in order to gain a thorough understanding of the epigenetic landscape. In this work, we suggest a novel method for predicting missing DNA methylation values in WGBS data, which is based on K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN).\n\n\nOur approach accurately imputes missing values by utilising the methylation data's inherent structure and patterns. KNN, an instance-based, non-parametric machine learning algorithm, is used to find comparable methylation profiles for each\n\n<!-- ### Public Health Relevance Statement -->\n<!-- In response to the evolving landscape of digital health information and the challenges posed by the rapid spread of misinformation, innovative AI-based solutions have emerged as powerful tools to enhance eHealth literacy and mitigate the impact of infodemics.

Recently, our group has shown that Typhi-specific phages are abundant in surface water collected from high typhoid burden settings in Bangladesh and phage abundance correlates with typhoid burden. However, no information is available regarding the infecting mechanisms of Typhi-phages and the role these phages play in the evolution and dynamics of Salmonella Typhi in the environment. In this study, we used a combination of whole genome sequencing and bacterial killing assays against a diverse panel of Salmonella Typhi isolates to characterize the Typhi-phages present in Bangladesh.\n\n**Keyword:** Water-borne diseases, factors, vibrio cholerae, public health, health impacts, calamities, water.\n\n\n# Single Cell RNA Seq Analysis\n## A Global Pediatric Cell Atlas of Nasal and Oral Mucosa\n### Abstract \nThe nasopharyngeal and oral mucosa represent the initial sites of interaction with many environmental agents and microbes. Recent single-cell studies have revealed a rich diversity of epithelial and immune cell types and states within nasopharyngeal epithelium in diseases of global significance, including allergic inflammation and viral infection. Yet, beyond an accessible window into disease biology, minimally-invasive sampling of the nose and mouth in children represents a truly unique opportunity to characterize healthy mucosal epithelial and immune function worldwide. However, a comprehensive map of epithelial and immune system development across diverse ancestries and environments is lacking. To more broadly investigate the nasal and oral mucosa and understand how the normal variation present in healthy children maintains health or may inform disease, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team: unifying experts in 7 cities in 5 countries who are deeply invested in understanding the single-cell biology of the nasopharyngeal and oral mucosa in children living within our communities. Our plan aims to generate scientific and community engagement in all phases of our research to establish the foundation in Years 1 and 2 that will enable us to carefully and considerately analyze 80 pediatric participants at each site (560 total) across the age range from 1-month to 18-years of age in the next phase of our network (potential Year 3 and beyond). Our team will pilot and analyze single-cell data jointly with scientists from all locations, and share important lessons in global science, protocols and resultant data openly with the community. Ultimately, our global single-cell based characterization of the developing nasopharyngeal mucosa will reveal principles of epithelial and immune system development that will facilitate the equitable development of novel therapies for diseases of the aerodigestive tracts.\n\n# Public Health\n## RSV Vaccine Impact Monte Carlo Simulation \n### Abstract \nThalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, poses a significant public health challenge in Bangladesh. This project outlines a comprehensive initiative aimed at the prevention and control of thalassemia within the country. The multifaceted approach integrates awareness campaigns, genetic screening, accessible healthcare services, and community engagement to mitigate the prevalence and impact of thalassemia.\n\nThe project's primary objectives include raising public awareness about thalassemia, educating communities about its genetic nature, and promoting informed family planning decisions. Additionally, the initiative seeks to establish a robust infrastructure for genetic screening, enabling early detection and intervention. This involves collaboration with healthcare institutions, laboratories, and medical professionals to ensure accurate and affordable testing.\n\nTo ensure equitable access to quality healthcare, the project focuses on enhancing healthcare facilities' capacity to provide specialized thalassemia care. This involves training healthcare personnel, ensuring the availability of necessary treatments, and creating a supportive environment for patients and their families. Moreover, the project emphasizes the importance of support groups and counseling services to address the psychological and emotional aspects of thalassemia.\n\n### Public Health Relevance Statement\nThis project's importance within the realm of public health cannot be overstated. By focusing on awareness campaigns and educational initiatives, the project aims to dispel misconceptions surrounding thalassemia, empower communities with accurate information, and reduce the stigma attached to the disorder. This proactive approach fosters a culture of informed decision-making, particularly in matters of family planning and genetic counseling.\n\n\n::: \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::  panel-tabset\n# AI for Healthcare  \n## Predicting Disease Spread of Dengue using LSTM\n\n### Abstract \nMosquito-borne dengue fever is a disease found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
