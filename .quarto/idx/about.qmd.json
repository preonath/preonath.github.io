Their work explores the complex dynamics of vaccination efficacy and its ramifications, thanks to the perceptive examination of Mohammad Abul Hasnat, Farhan Rahman Niloy, Arafat Islam Ashik, Mahedi Hasan, Preonath Chondrow Dev, Sharmin Sultana Panna, Md. Waseque Mia, and Zafrul Hasan. In the meanwhile, they continue to explore the complex terrain of diabetes, concentrating on the incidence of hyperlipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who are under control as well as those who are not.
