# Bio
I am *[Preonath Chondrow Dev](https://preonath.github.io/)*. I am a **Bioinformatician** at the [Child Health Research Foundation](https://chrfbd.org/) working to improve child health in Bangladesh and around the world by facilitating appropriate policy decisions through research and advocacy. I am also a mentor at the [Bioinformatics School](https://www.facebook.com/groups/390262838074549/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=1429385037495652).

As a **bioinformatician**, I combine my knowledge in **biochemistry, molecular biology, and computer science** to advance human health by developing and implementing state-of-the-art computational methods. I aim to uncover the genomic complexities of diseases through highly engaging and fruitful collaborations.
