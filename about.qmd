# Bio
I am *[Preonath Chondrow Dev](https://preonath.github.io/)*. I am a **Bioinformatician** at the [Child Health Research Foundation](https://chrfbd.org/) to improve child health in Bangladesh and around the world by facilitating appropriate policy decisions through research and advocacy. I am also working as a mentor at [Bioinformatics School](https://www.facebook.com/groups/390262838074549/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=1429385037495652). 

As a **bioinformatician**, I combine my knowledge in **biochemistry, molecular biology, and computer science** to further the cause of improving human health by developing and implementing state-of-the-art computational methods with the sincere intention of illuminating the route to new discoveries and solutions by teasing apart the genomic complexities of diseases through highly engaging and fruitful collaborations.



<!-- # Research Interests -->

<!-- - **Public Health:** Monte Carlo simulations have been used extensively in medical research to evaluate the possible effects of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccinations. Their work explores the complex dynamics of vaccination efficacy and its ramifications, thanks to the perceptive examination of Mohammad Abul Hasnat, Farhan Rahman Niloy, Arafat Islam Ashik, Mahedi Hasan, Preonath Chondrow Dev, Sharmin Sultana Panna, Md. Waseque Mia, and Zafrul Hasan. In the meanwhile, they continue to explore the complex terrain of diabetes, concentrating on the incidence of hyperlipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who are under control as well as those who are not. This dual emphasis highlights the interdisciplinary character of modern medical research, where clinical nuances and quantitative modelling collide to promote a comprehensive understanding of public health issues. -->

<!-- - **Genomics:** Gene Expression,Epigenomics,Evolutionary Genomics,Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH),Pharmacogenomics,Metagenomics,Cancer Genomics,Structural Genomics,Synthetic Genomics,Nutrigenomics,Single-Cell Genomics,Ancient DNA (aDNA),Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genomics. -->

<!-- - **Metagenomics:** Vir metagenomics,Functional Metagenomics,Environmental Monitoring,Host-Microbiome Interactions,Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance,Ecofunctional Profiling,Extreme Environments,Community Dynamics,Biogeochemical Cycling,Bioinformatics and Computational Tools. -->

<!-- - **AI for Public Health(AI4PH):** AI for Public Health is an interdisciplinary research field that aims to address a range of public health concerns by utilising machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. Innovating approaches to analysing massive datasets, enhancing decision-making processes in the public health sector, developing diagnostic tools, optimising healthcare delivery, and predicting health trends are all explored by researchers in this subject. Utilising AI's potential to improve population-wide health outcomes, prevent sickness, and foster well-being is the ultimate objective.. -->

<!-- - **Integrated Multi-Omics Data:** Integrating multi-omics data sets—genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other fields—is a major area of interest for me. With this all-encompassing approach, I am able to obtain a thorough understanding of the molecular terrain of cancer. I work to find new biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and pathways that can have a big influence on cancer diagnosis and therapy by examining many layers of biological data. -->
